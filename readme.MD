# Art in Five

Art in Five is an app that introduces users to Singapore art through a concise slide deck that summaries the works, styles and influences of key artists through five artworks.

The project is inspired by the lack of well-designed online resources dedicated to Singapore art.

App is deployed on: https://steph-wong.github.io/art-in-five

Database is deployed on: https://ancient-wave-42701.herokuapp.com


### User Story

Art in Five's simple interface brings users from the landing page to a listing of artists where they may click on a selected artist to bring up a six-page deck that brings them through the artist's basic bio, background, influence, style, an iconic work, and a list of similar Singapore artists.


### Approach Taken

A collaboration between two student web developers, the project is split between front end and back end development.


### Technologies Used

**Frameworks**
- jQuery, Ajax
- Bootstrap

**Plugins**
- [Wow](https://github.com/matthieua/WOW) (animated scrolling)
- [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) (cross-browser animation)
- [FullPage](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/) (one-page scrolling)
- [Smooth Scroll](https://plugins.jquery.com/smooth-scroll/) (scrolling for same-page links)


### Unsolved Problems

- as there isn't an API for Singapore art, the team had to research and manually input data to the database, thus limiting the entries available
- edit function not implemented to database yet
- navigation bar remains transparent when linked from different page
- popup styling can be improved
- implement effective pedagogy to enhance learning experience
